# couch-ar is a thin active record implementation for couchDB

## Motivation

 The idea behind couch-ar is to provide an easy to use active record
 implementation while  keeping the speed of node.js.  For this reason
 couch-ar does not add a lot of abstraction.  My aim is to provide an
 easy way to have full domain constructors while writing only the
 required information to the db document.

 Domain constructors are defined in advance with couch-ar
 in a simple format that includes a list of properties to write to the DB.

## Installation
You can install in one of two ways: 

1) Download the index.js file and place it in .node_libraries/couch-ar.

-- or --

2) npm install couch-ar

NOTE: You also need to install cradle


## How to use

The best way to see how it works is to run the included tests.
    cd to test
    ./specs.sh

The tests are written using jasmine-node.
For information on how to run the tests using this module, please refer
to the jasmin-node documentation.  I have included only enough to run the
tests.

The first step is to run the init method to generate the database and read
your domain files.

        require('couch-ar').init({
            dbName: 'couch-ar-test',                    // The database name - couch-ar will create the database
            root: __dirname + '../testDomain'           // The root of the domain constructors
        }, function(db){ // passes back the cradle connection });

Next, create your domain files in ../testDomain like this:

        var domain = require('couch-ar');

        exports.TestUser = domain.create('TestUser',{
            properties:{
                username: {},
                password: {},
                firstName:{},
                lastName: {},
                fullName: {}
            }
        }, function(that) {
            that.beforeSave = function() {
                that.fullName = that.firstName + ' ' + that.lastName;
            }
            return that;
        });

I am using Douglas Crockford's parasitic inheritance and power constructors.
To understand my code it is best to understand this style.

After running init() the domain constructors are available from the couch-ar object.

    var domain = require('couch-ar');
    domain.TestUser.create({})


## Before Hooks

domain constructors can include a hook beforeSave() that will be run before a document
is saved or updated in the DB.


## create()

couch-ar adds a static factory for constructing domain objects using a parameter map.
Simply call Domain.create({}) passing a map of parameters to add to the object.  

example:
    domain.TestUser.create({username:'me'})


## save()

Saves or updates an existing document.

     user.save(function(err, res){  })


## remove()

Removes a document from the DB:

    user.remove(function(err, res) {});


## list()

List all documents

   domain.TestUser.list(function(users){});


## findByXxx() / findAllByXxx()

Every property gets a findBy or findAllBy method.  The usage is pretty simple:

    domain.TestUser.findAllByUsername('scott', function(users){ // passed the user objects })
    domain.TestUser.findById('xxxxxx', function(user){})


## properties

id = the DB id

rev = the DB revision

dateCreated = the date the object was first saved to the DB

lastUpdated = the date the object was last updated


## custom views

You can also add custom views to any domain constructor

The following example will create a view to find a user by first or last name:

    exports.TestUser = domain.create('TestUser',{
        properties:{
            username: {},
            password: {},
            firstName:{},
            lastName: {},
        },
        views: {
            firstOrLastName: {map: function(doc) {
                emit(doc.firstName, doc);
                emit(doc.lastName, doc);
            }}
        }
    });

This code will also add static finders:

    domain.TestUser.findAllByFirstOrLastName('Test',function() {});
    domain.TestUser.findByFirstOrLastName('Tester',function() {});
